So, \"technically\" her statement is true that Bush didn't create a great deal of new jobs.HOWEVER, the fact that he MAINTAINED and averaged \"full employment\" until Pelosi and the Dems took over the purse strings should say more about THEIR failures than his! And even if you include the last two years of complete Democrat failure, you will see that he averaged around 6% unemployment - which is MORE THAN RESPECTABLE!
